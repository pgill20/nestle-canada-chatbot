## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### **Local Development:**
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/pgill20/nestle-canada-chatbot.git
cd nestle-canada-chatbot

# Setup environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here" > .env

# Run application
python app.py

# Access at http://localhost:8000
```

**Note:** Location services require HTTPS. On localhost, the app will offer simulated location data for testing.

### **Testing Enhanced Features:**

#### **1. Location-Based Store Finder**
- Click the location icon in chatbot header (red/green indicator)
- Allow location permission when prompted
- Try queries like: "Where can I buy KitKat nearby?"
- Click product cards for instant location-based searches

#### **2. Product Count Queries**
- "How many Nestl√© products are listed on the site?"
- "How many coffee products are there?"
- "Show me chocolate product count"

#### **3. Amazon Purchase Integration**  
- "Where can I buy Quality Street online?"
- Click any product card for combined store + online options
- Direct links to Amazon Canada with product details

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Azure Deployment

### **Quick Deployment:**
```bash
# Create deployment package
zip -r deploy.zip . -x "*.git*" "__pycache__/*" "*.pyc" "venv/*" ".env" "app-logs/*" "LogFiles/*" "*.DS_Store"

# Deploy to existing Azure app
az webapp deploy --resource-group nestle-chatbot-rg --name nestle-chatbot-app --src-path deploy.zip --type zip
```

### **New API Endpoints:**
```bash
# Get product counts  
GET /product-counts

# Get product information with Amazon links
GET /products  

# Enhanced chat with location context
POST /chat
{
    "message": "Where can I buy KitKat nearby?",
    "location": {"latitude": 43.5890, "longitude": -79.6441}
}
```

## üéØ Round 2 Requirements - Complete Implementation

| Requirement | Status | Implementation |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
